Description:
    This generator makes it easier for developers to create a new pearl plugin. It generates a ruby file with required method stubs for a plugin as well as a blank json file to place the storyboard json into.

Example:
    rails generate pearl_plugin some_verb

    This will create:
        lib/pearl_engine/json_files/some_verb.json
        app/models/pearl_engine/plugins/some_verb_plugin.rb
